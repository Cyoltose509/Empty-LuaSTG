The large lake at the foot of Youkai Mountain.
The lakeside is lush with grass and shaded by trees,
with mist on the lake often enveloping the shore.

There are many fairies here,
but they have become quite commonplace.
You might also encounter some peculiar, arrogant,
and rare "big shots"...?]],

The pure lunar breeze silently ripples across the sea.
Apart from the wind, nothing else disturbs the water.
Are there no creatures inhabiting this sea?

In the sea, mechanical wreckage and flags drift,
symbolizing the dreams of those impure humans
who sleep here.]],
