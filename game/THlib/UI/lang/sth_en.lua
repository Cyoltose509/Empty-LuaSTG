1. The author, to satisfy his own desires, designed this "Consecrate" system.
This system  is §rpurely fictional§d.
The so-called character unlock, Items get, §rdo not provide real feedback in
"Gensokyo". Please consider it as part of the fun and §rdo not take it too seriously
unless necessary.

2. During normal gameplay, there is a small chance that enemies will drop §yPearls§d.
In this page, consuming one §yPearl§d grants one §gGoodOmen§d.

3. The number of §gGoodOmen§d is limited, and each consecrating decreases the
count by one. Note that once the total number of obtained §yPearl§d exceeds the
number of §gGoodOmen§d, the probability of obtaining §yPearl§din the game will be
greatly reduced.

4. When making an Consecrate, click on the §yPearl§d to perform the ritual.
It will emit blue, purple, or gold light, granting a corresponding §gGoodOmen§d.
§gGoodOmens§d are categorized into three levels based on the color of the light:
§bRegularOmen§d: Gains money;
§pLuckyOmen§d: Unlocks Items that appear during gameplay;
§yGreatOmen§d: Unlocks characters and their talents.

§bRegularOmen§d are the most common,
§pLuckyOmen§d are rare, and §yGreatOmen§d are the rarest.

5. If the §gGoodOmens§d include §pLuckyOmen§d,
then one out of every 10 consecrating will contain a §pLuckyOmen§d.
If the §gGoodOmens§d include §yGreatOmen§d,
then one out of every 40 consecrating will contain a §yGreatOmen§d.
